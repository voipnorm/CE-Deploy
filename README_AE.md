CE Feature Deployment Tool (CE-Deploy)
=====================================
Desktop application for deploying CE based device features to Webex Room devices.

Supports deployment of the following features:

* Wallpapers
* Macro Files
* Touch 10 UI controls
* Download logs for troubleshooting
* Digital Signage
* Branding
* Webex Board Touch 10 enablement
* Disable Webex Assistant

**Business/Technical Challenge**

Not every feature and function of Webex Room devices is controllable from an administrative interface regardless of whether it is on-premise or in the cloud. 
CE-Deploy helps to automate pushing some of the most common or hard to deploy features at a large scale with a simple desktop tool.
