                            Welcome to CE-Deploy(CED). CED is meant to be a easy to use tool that helps fill the gaps
                            from other deployment tools such as CUCM or TMS. CED takes advantage of the putXML API that
                            all CE firmware supports. While certain features will be dependant on your CE or codec
                            version, this tool will attempt to deploy all features requested of it. <b>It does not do a
                            version check</b> to see if your load of firmware or codec is compatible with the attempted features to
                            be deployed. As an example, macros are not available on the SX10 codec.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a few things you will need to get started with CED:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A local admin or integrator account on each endpoint</li>
                            <li>The password for said account</li>
                            <li>A CSV file with the IP addresses or DNS resolvable names of endpoints</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once you have these items its time to get started deploying your files or digital signage.
                            Let the fun begin!
                        </p>

                            Your username and password will require the use of a local admin account on the codec you
                            are trying to configure. While cloud endpoints are supported, the requirement for a locally
                            provisioned account is still applicable. Permissions required for provisioning your endpoint
                            will vary depending on
                            the feature and function desired but most changes can be achieved with the ROOMCONTROL and
                            INTEGRATOR
                            permission set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you have entered your Username and Password into the interface you can do a credential
                            check. The credential check requires that a CSV is loaded into CED using the file browser
                            dialog with at least one valid IP address. The credential check button can then be pressed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Selecting the secure deployment check box will only allow the use of https to deploy files
                            and settings. In some cases this is required as http has been disabled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Credentials check will take the first IP address in the CSV file and do a XML poll of
                            the endpoint using <i>getStatus</i> on the endpoint. If the <i>getStatus</i> is successful the green
                            "Authentication Successful" will appear. If it fails you will be presented with a red
                            "Authentication Failed" and you are by definition a looser. Funny, I can say what I want in
                            here I just really wanted to see how far you would read this boring crap before I attempted
                            to lighten the mood.

                            Using the file browser dialog, a CSV file with endpoint IP address or domain names can be
                            uploaded to deploy files to your endpoints. This file can be created using
                            MS Excel or other text editor and saved as a CSV file. See example below:
                        </p>
                        <img src="./images/csvExample.jpg" alt="csvExample" height="300" width="300">
                        <p>
                            All endpoints in the CSV will be loaded into the application and any deploy action taken
                            will affect all endpoints listed in the CSV file. The only exception to this is the credential
                            check which only uses the first entry in the CSV file to validate.
                            Note, the credential check is a only done via the Check Credentials button.
                            Failure to check your credentials may lead to extended authentication failures due to
                            incorrect password or username. At this time, once the deployment is underway there is no
                            turning back and CED will run its full course regardless of authentication failures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The recomended best practice is to ensure that all IP addresses are actually video codecs, online and
                            reachable. While processing will continue should an issue arises, the time it takes to
                            complete the deployment will increase with unresponsive IP address or unresolvable device
                            names. Cloud registered devices on the Internet may be unreachable for the tool
                            although they may be online. Ever get confused by the use of may be and maybe? I do all the
                            time.

                            CED can deploy touch 10 XML files and macro files. Touch 10 XML files alter the layout of a
                            touch 10 controller and macros are used to extend the functionality of the codec using
                            Javascript running inside the codec's macro engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two options once you have selected the UI Control option inside the tabbed
                            deployment interface; Config and Panel.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Config allows the deployment of an entire touch 10 XML file and will deploy multiple
                                panels overwriting existing panels on the codec. <B>Be careful with this option</b>, once you
                                blow away your old panels there ain't no going back. Unless you have a backup XML then
                                you can go back, which makes total sense. Also reminds me of a movie about going back to
                                the future, I think it was called "going back in time" or something.
                            </li>
                            <li>Panel overwrites or adds a single panel using an XML file. Its similar to the merge
                                feature in the admin Web portal. If you want a panel to be merged give it a unique ID.
                                If you want it to overwrite use the same panel ID as one that already exists.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Both options allow the use of a XML file downloaded from a previously configured Touch 10
                            controller using the in-room configuration tool. The Panel option will error if the XML file
                            uploaded has more than one panel but this only occurs during deployment. Make sure to
                            select the right deployment option other wise you will end up sitting there waiting and all
                            you will get is errors. In future versions this may be checked for you, but for now it is not.

                            How many times have raised a TAC case only to need to download the log files? Well now this
                            tool can help with those use cases as well as the need to do regular mass download from
                            multiple endpoints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CED makes the request to the endpoint for all log files bundled in a gzip format. Once the
                            request has been granted, CED streams the log files from the codec to a download directory.
                            All log files are named with the endpoint IP address and a timestamp to make identification easy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To access the log files after the completion of the download use the Tools>Downloaded Logs
                            menu. This will open the file browser on your OS giving your access to the files
                            downloaded. Downloading from multiple endpoints is done in sequence so if the volume of
                            endpoints is large, it can take some time for the job to complete. To monitor the creation of
                            logs as the process completes open the Downloaded Logs directroy through the tools menu to
                            ensure logs are being created.

                            You may be wondering why it has not been this simple till now. The wallpaper API is still
                            considered a unsupported API. So while it may work as of CE9.6 future versions this function
                            may be removed or it may in fact end up being supported.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, don't worry if this function is a little slow. The Wallpaper image is streamed down
                            to each endpoint. The larger the scale of your wallpaper the longer it will take. Just
                            keep that in mind. Branding on the other hand works very differently so skip to the next
                            section and stop giving me grief on how hard it is to deploy wallpaper punk.

                            The wonderful world of branding; it's so much better than wallpaper. While branding is pretty
                            cool, its only available on CE devices not including the SX10. For the SX10 wallpaper its your
                            only personalization option as of CE9.6. Sucks to be an SX10, right! Yeah, you know it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I am not going to cover every facet of branding, this option allows you to upload awake
                            and half awake logos and a background logo. Its pretty straight forward and as of today PNG
                            and JPEG formats are accepted, at least by this tool. No not me, CED! How dare you? Only my
                            wife gets to call me that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly on branding, if you had previously deployed wallpaper and are moving to branding, this
                            tool will disable wallpaper and upload your branding images. Unlike wallpaper branding, this uses
                            base 64 encoding to transfer the images as text which are then decoded by the endpoint. The
                            encoding process only happens once inside CED and then the resulting file is sent to your
                            endpoints. This means its a much faster deployment process then wallpaper. Got it? Good.
                            Don't make me repeat myself. Actually if you need me to repeat it just scroll up and reread
                            it.

                        From time to time an error may occur. Once the job you have deployed has completed an indication
                        of the number of errors is shown under the progress bar.

                        To access the application log and check for errors go to Tools>Application Log. This will open
                        the application log in your default text editor.

                        The End. I need a coffee after all that. Do you know how long it took me to type all this out. I
                        was up past midnight last night and on a Sunday. Yeah you better be grateful. Now get the hell
                        out of here and go deploy something!
